asked about algae control in water ,"Domestic water storage tanks require proper care to keep the water healthy. Water is an essential natural resource and therefore preserving a safe water is a must. Water is life and pure and safe water is a must to lead a healthy life. Direct exposure to sunlight accelerates the growth of algae. In case of overhead water tanks, this is a common problem faced especially during summers as the tank is always exposed to direct sun.

Algae is a bacteria that carry harmful toxins for consumption. In order to prevent it from the growth of algae, there are certain precautions to be taken. To keep the water algae free, follow the simple steps mentioned below:

Use an opaque water storage tank. Change the water tank color from white to black. The ultraviolet rays in sunlight damage the plastic of the tank. Therefore black colored tanks are so popular as it absorbs all the harsh UV rays of the sun and does not allow it to enter the tank. the other way is to get the tank painted black inside if you prefer another color outside. But nowadays even other colored water tanks come with UV radiators that protect the same from the harmful ultraviolet rays.
Clean the tank properly every three to six months in case of indirect sunlight. In case of direct sunlight, cleaning should be done more often. Drain all water and give a good scrubbing to the tank. Use appropriate supplies to clean the tank and thoroughly rinse before you refill them. Do not forget to filter the tank after it is cleaned as it further helps in removing loose algae.
Certain chemicals like chlorine stop algae growth. It is ideal to add 4 parts of chlorine to every 1,000,000 parts of water. The water is safe to drink with this proportion. This ratio is very important and should be followed otherwise the water might become harmful.
Bleach kills algae and stops its further growth. Add 1/4 teaspoon of bleach to every gallon of water stored. The ratio again is important here otherwise it may have negative effects on the water.
Another simple way is to keep the tank covered with tarpaulin or grass or natural vegetation around the tanks can also be planted such as creepers.
With these simple tips, you can keep the algae at bay and ensure your safety for years to come."
