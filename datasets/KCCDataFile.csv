Due to low temperature for late sowing, due to low wheat foliage the seed should be kept in the ratio of 125 to 150 kg per hectare. Seed treatment should be used for seeding of 75-100 kg per hectare.
Before sowing, seeds should be processed in the quantity of Captain or Thayaram fungicide with 3 gm per kg seed.
